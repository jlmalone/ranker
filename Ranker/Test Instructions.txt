I want you to write unit tests and some integration tests that run on the simulator
Especially testing the database.


Please also write me readme description documentation for each section of the app. The major use cases and functions
The major User journeys

Write me high level deocumentation for each major feature of the app that let's say future developers
and LLMs and AI agents can absorb for context and then to better understand to continue developing and building

Based on the journeys and the different features, write me more unit tests and more integration tests for a simulator

Because I do not want to risk data on the physical device to be corrupted or wiped out, I want a flag there
So that testing can only be performed on the simulator
