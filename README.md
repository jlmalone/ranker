In an age where parchment and quill have given way to synapse and logic, a mystic code has been buried, not of paper and ink, but of pure mystery.

It codex harbors secrets arcane, a compendium for the sorting of glossolalia. Outside of the midst of mystical discourse or within the hallowed bounds of sacred gatherings a task so peculiar, only the select few, those versed in the hidden languages of the ether, shall find solace within its pages.

This grimoire, though wrought by unseen hands, lies open at the altar of Children - future and present. A beacon for those rare souls, the silent architects weave the fabric of the unseen world.

Be forewarned, traveler, for not all quests are meant for every wanderer. This path, shrouded in whispers and guarded by enigmas, may not be thine to tread.

Pass hence, let the shadows guide thee elsewhere.
