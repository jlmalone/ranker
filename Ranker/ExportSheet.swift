//TODO make a view where the user can select tlhe databases for export. Save to an accessible file location
//on the device and share to google drive.
// there will be thousands of medium sized files. I need a strategy for the best ways to back them up.

//I need a way to export all the databases also
//ie trigrams,  word rankings, associated word recordings, associated word text entry freeform, associated recording transcripts

//give me a good interface and give me a navigation mechanism from the share sheet to figure this out.

// the export sheet should also have a means to delete transcripts and recordings from the device after they have
// been successfully exported
