### The Foundation

*Purpose:* The core functionality revolves around ranking short alphanumeric strings (3-letter combinations, 1-4 digit numbers).

### Strengths:
    - Solid, functional core for ranking basic strings.
    - Clear separation of UI, ViewModel, and Database logic.
    - Effective use of SQLite.swift for persistence.
    - Basic progress and export features already implemented.
    
### Weaknesses/Limitations (as per your new requirements):
    - Designed for "word fragments" (3-letter combos, numbers), not full words or email content.
    - No concept of "associated words" or "audio notes."
    - Word.id using UUID() but the database is set up with Int64 primary keys for id (which SQLite.swift usually auto-increments). This is a potential mismatch; if Word is initialized from the database, the id from the DB will be Int64, but if new Word objects are created, UUID() is used. This can cause issues.

### Roadmap: 

#### New suite of extended functionality:
    - For a full word in email: how to rank it.
    - For a particular word: list of associated words/phrases (password ideas).
    - For a particular word fragment: record audio with associated ideas.
